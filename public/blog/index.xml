      <description>So, with Net Neutrality getting tossed out the window, we’ve decided to get the project going again. News will be coming, as we are currently working on the first inter-community link.
If you are interested in becoming a node operator, feel free to reach out to us at contact@buffalomesh.net Or, use our contact form.
Also, BuffaloMesh.net has launched our localized social media platform, and is accessible at https://social.buffalomesh.net. It runs the Mastodon platform, which allows you to connect with other users on instances located across the globe.</description>
