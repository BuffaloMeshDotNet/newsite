So, with Net Neutrality getting tossed out the window, we’ve decided to get the project going again.  News will be coming, as we are currently working on the first inter-community link.

If you are interested in becoming a node operator, feel free to reach out to us at contact@buffalomesh.net Or, use our contact form.

Also, BuffaloMesh.net has launched our localized social media platform, and is accessible at https://social.buffalomesh.net.  It runs the Mastodon platform, which allows you to connect with other users on instances located across the globe.  Each instance is individually owned, and operated.  So, join us there, and get out from under the corporate managed view of the internet.
