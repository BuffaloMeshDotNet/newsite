We are a not-for-profit organization, looking to build a data service that allows everyone the ability to access required services such as health, educational, and political information.  We are also looking to provide access to services that most individuals in todayâ€™s society consider to be basic services, such as email, and voice services.

We originally started as a two individuals sitting down for coffee in August of 2014, trying to figure out how to make Buffalo a smarter city that also allows those who are typically considered under-served to have the same access as everyone else to various data and information served.

Currently, we are not registered as a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation, so donations to this project are not tax deductible.  However, we are in the process of doing so.
